## Fundamental assumptions {#fundAssump -}

:::{.definition #fundAssumptions name="fundamental assumptions of blockchains"}
Throughout these notes, we assume the existence of: 

1. A correct, secure digital signature scheme (definition \@ref(def:digSig) below). 
    - Allows node $A$ to verify $B$'s claim that "node $C$ said ...". 
2. Point-to-point communication (internet). Minimal assumptions on latency / reliability. 
:::

:::{.definition #digSig name="digital signature scheme"}
A **digital signature scheme** consists of three algorithms, $\m{Gen}, \m{Sign}, \m{Vf}$ satisfying: 

- $\m{Gen}(1^\lambda) = \m{pk, sk}$: consumes a security parameter $\lambda$ to generate a (public, secret)-key pair. 
- $\m{Sign}(\m{sk}, m) = \sigma$: consumes a secret key and a message to obtain a signature. 
- $\m{Vf}(\m{pk}, m, \sigma) = \{0, 1\}$: verification consuming public key, message, and signature to output acceptance or rejection. 

A digital signature scheme $(\m{Gen}, \m{Sign}, \m{Vf})$ is: 

1. **correct** if $\m{Vf}(\m{pk}, m, \m{Sign}(\m{sk}, m)) = 1$. 
2. **secure** if no poly-$\lambda$ adversary can forge an acceptable signature reliably. 
:::

Note that the signature must be message-dependent, else signatures can be copied to sign other messages. 

We consider **nodes**, which are local computers which can run code and communicate with each other in a point-to-point fashion. A **protocol** is an algorithm which a node can run. 

:::{.definition #permissionSetting name="permissioned setting"}
The set of nodes responsible for running the protocol is known up front. In other words, the protocol description itself can reference specific nodes which are running it. 

- For a company managing database copies, permissioned setting is natural. 
- Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols are likely permissionless. 
:::

:::{.definition #pki name="public key infrastructure"}
Stronger assumption than permissioned setting: all nodes have distinct public-private key pairs, and public keys are common knowledge. 
:::

:::{.definition #syncModel name="synchronous model"}
The synchronous model, nodes have: 

1. **Shared global clock**: nodes can agree on a global timestep. 
2. **Bounded message delays**: w.l.o.g., message sent at time $t$ will be delivered by $t+1$. 
:::


## Single-shot consensus {#singleShot -}

Consider a sequence of $[n]=\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ nodes. Given a protocol, nodes are of the following types; we may know a bound on the number of nodes in each type, but we do not know the nodes' identity:  

- **Honest**: executes the prescribed protocol. This includes both the _validity_ and _timeliness_ of messages. 
- **Byzantine**: behaves arbitrarily; byzantine nodes can collude. 

:::{.definition #bbSetup name="Byzantine Broadcast"} 
We're working in a permissioned setting. 

1. One node is the **sender** and the other non-senders. The sender's identity is common knowledge. 
2. The sender has access to _private input_ $v^*\in V$. 

A solution to the Byzantine broadcast problem must satisfy: 

1. **Termination**: every honest node $j$ eventually halts with some output $v\in V$. 
2. **Agreement**: all honest nodes halt with the same output, irrespective of whether the sender is honest. 
3. **Validity**: if the sender is honest, then the common output of honest nodes is $v^*$.

Note that agreement without validity is trivial (all nodes output $\perp$), as well as validity without agreement (echo sender). Also note that validity implies agreement when the sender is honest. 
:::

:::{.definition #convMessDS name="convincing message"}
Node $j$ is convinced of value $v$ at time $t$ if it receives _a message_ prior to $t$ that: 

1. References $v$. 
2. Signed first by the sender. 
3. Also signed by at least $t-1$ distinct non-sender nodes apart from $j$. 
:::

:::{.definition #dolevStrong name="Dolev-Strong protocol"}
At $t=0$, the sender sends $v^*$ to all nodes and outputs $v^*$. Next repeat for $t=1, \dots, f+1$: 

- If a non-sender $j$ is newly convinced of $v$ at time $t$ by message $m$, the node adds its own signature to $m$ and sends $(m, s)$ to all other non-senders. 

For each nonsender, if outputs $v$ it's convinced by exactly one $v$, else outputs $\perp$. 
:::

:::{.theorem #dolevStrongResult name="Dolev-Strong"}
Byzantine Broadcast \@ref(def:bbSetup) is solvable under: 

- Permissioned setting with $n$ nodes \@ref(def:permissionSetting) under PKI assumptions \@ref(def:pki). 
- Synchronous communication \@ref(def:syncModel). 
- Arbitrary bound on Byzantine nodes. Note that the $f=n, n-1$ case satisfies validity and agreement trivially. 
:::

<details>
<summary>Proof idea: honest nodes broadcast what they're convinced by, and protocol runs for long enough so that there're not enough Byzantine nodes to collude</summary>
Let's first prove validity; considering an honest sender (validity only has bite for honest senders), an honest node can only ever be convinced of $v^*$ since convincing messages has to be signed by the sender, and Byzantine nodes can't forge the sender's signature. Honest non-senders are also convinced by the honest sender at $t=0$. 

Proceeding to agreement: validity implies agreement if the sender is honest. Assuming Byzantine sender, we prove that when protocol terminates, _all honest non-senders are convinced of the same set of values_. Assuming that an honest non-sender $j$ is _newly_ convinced at: 

- $t\leq f$: this implies that the sender and $t-1$ non-senders signed the message. Then $j$ proceeds to sign the message and broadcast; this message convinces all non-senders at $t+1$. 
- $t=f+1$: this implies that the Byzantine sender and $t-1=f$ non-senders signed the message. Since there're at most $f$ Byzantine nodes, at least one honest non-sender has signed the message, so all other nodes are convinced. 

Note that the $t=f+1$ round of checks is paramount; suppose we terminate at time $t$, then the Byzantine nodes can collude to produce a convincing message to one of the honest nodes, which does not have time to broadcast this to other honest nodes. 
</details>

:::{.definition #baSetup name="Byzantine Agreement"}
Similar to Byzantine broadcast \@ref(def:bbSetup), but each node has private bit $b_j\in \{0, 1\}$ with at most $f$ Byzantine nodes. Solution must satisfy termination and: 

1. Agreement: all honest nodes output the same bit. 
2. Validity: when all nodes have the same private input, they all terminate with $b$. 
:::

:::{.theorem #singleShotReduction name="deterministic BA-BB reduction"}
Given $f<n/2$, there exists a deterministic BA solution iff there exists a deterministic BB solution. 
:::

Given $\pi$ solving the BB problem, construct a BA protocol as follows: 

1. Nodes take turn to Byzantine-broadcast their private input $b_j$. 
2. Output majority value. 

- Validity: when all nodes have the same private input $b$, their private inputs are consistently broadcasted to all other honest nodes _since $\pi$ is valid_. Since $f<n/2$, honest nodes have consistent output by majority vote. 
- Consistency: all honest nodes have the same "perception" of other nodes, so majority votes are consistent. 

Given a BA protocol $\pi$, construct a BB protocol as follows: 

1. $T=0$: non-senders run BA with $b_j=0$, sender runs with $v^*$. 
2. $T=1$: non-senders run BA with $b_j=1$, sender runs with $v^*$. 

## State-machine replication {#smr -}

Byzantine broadcast is also known as a **one-shot consensus** problem. We proceed to **multi-shot consensus** and demonstrate reduction to Byzantine Broadcast. 

:::{.definition #smrSetup name="state-machine replication"} 
We're working in a permissioned setting. Each honest node receives an incoming stream of requests and attempts to make this common knowledge; it also maintains an **append-only log**. A solution should satisfy 

1. **Liveliness**: every request to an honest node is eventually included in the log of honest nodes. 
2. **Consistency**: at any time, the log of each honest replica are pairwise prefixes (i.e. order cannot be messed up). 
:::

:::{.theorem #smrBBReduction name="SMR reduces to BB"}
In a synchronous and permissioned setting with PKI, given a BB protocol $\pi$ which terminates in time $T$, there exists a solution to SMR. At each step $0, T, 2T, 3T, \dots$ 

1. Define the leader node by round-robin ordering. 
2. The leader collects its own not-yet-included requests and appends them to its local log. 
3. The leader broadcasts the updated local log via $\pi$. 
4. When $\pi$ terminates, every node $j$ appends its not-yet-included requests to the received log. 
:::

<details>
<summary>BB (validity, agreement)$\implies$ SMR (liveliness, consistency)</summary>
Liveliness: request submitted to $j$ will be included in the log of all honest nodes when it's $j$'s term to be the leader, by $\pi$'s _validity_ property. 

Consistency: $\pi$'s consistency implies that nodes execute the appending operation consistently.
