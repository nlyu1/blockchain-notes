Fundamental assumptions Definition 1.1 (fundamental assumptions of blockchains) Throughout these notes, we assume the existence of: A correct, secure digital signature scheme (definition 1.2 below). Allows node \\(A\\) to verify \\(B\\)’s claim that “node \\(C\\) said …”. Point-to-point communication (internet). Minimal assumptions on latency / reliability. Definition 1.2 (digital signature scheme) A digital signature scheme consists of three algorithms, \\(\\mathrm{Gen}, \\mathrm{Sign}, \\mathrm{Vf}\\) satisfying: \\(\\mathrm{Gen}(1^\\lambda) = \\mathrm{pk, sk}\\): consumes a security parameter \\(\\lambda\\) to generate a (public, secret)-key pair. \\(\\mathrm{Sign}(\\mathrm{sk}, m) = \\sigma\\): consumes a secret key and a message to obtain a signature. \\(\\mathrm{Vf}(\\mathrm{pk}, m, \\sigma) = \\{0, 1\\}\\): verification consuming public key, message, and signature to output acceptance or rejection. A digital signature scheme \\((\\mathrm{Gen}, \\mathrm{Sign}, \\mathrm{Vf})\\) is: correct if \\(\\mathrm{Vf}(\\mathrm{pk}, m, \\mathrm{Sign}(\\mathrm{sk}, m)) = 1\\). secure if no poly-\\(\\lambda\\) adversary can forge an acceptable signature reliably. Note that the signature must be message-dependent, else signatures can be copied to sign other messages. We consider nodes, which are local computers which can run code and communicate with each other in a point-to-point fashion. A protocol is an algorithm which a node can run. Definition 1.3 (permissioned setting) The set of nodes responsible for running the protocol is known up front. In other words, the protocol description itself can reference specific nodes which are running it. For a company managing database copies, permissioned setting is natural. Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols are likely permissionless. Definition 1.4 (public key infrastructure) Stronger assumption than permissioned setting: all nodes have distinct public-private key pairs, and public keys are common knowledge. Definition 1.5 (synchronous model) The synchronous model, nodes have: Shared global clock: nodes can agree on a global timestep. Bounded message delays: w.l.o.g., message sent at time \\(t\\) will be delivered by \\(t+1\\). Single-shot consensus Consider a sequence of \\([n]=\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\) nodes. Given a protocol, nodes are of the following types; we may know a bound on the number of nodes in each type, but we do not know the nodes’ identity: Honest: executes the prescribed protocol. This includes both the validity and timeliness of messages. Byzantine: behaves arbitrarily; byzantine nodes can collude. Definition 1.6 (Byzantine Broadcast) We’re working in a permissioned setting. One node is the sender and the other non-senders. The sender’s identity is common knowledge. The sender has access to private input \\(v^*\\in V\\). A solution to the Byzantine broadcast problem must satisfy: Termination: every honest node \\(j\\) eventually halts with some output \\(v\\in V\\). Agreement: all honest nodes halt with the same output, irrespective of whether the sender is honest. Validity: if the sender is honest, then the common output of honest nodes is \\(v^*\\). Note that agreement without validity is trivial (all nodes output \\(\\perp\\)), as well as validity without agreement (echo sender). Also note that validity implies agreement when the sender is honest. Definition 1.7 (convincing message) Node \\(j\\) is convinced of value \\(v\\) at time \\(t\\) if it receives a message prior to \\(t\\) that: References \\(v\\). Signed first by the sender. Also signed by at least \\(t-1\\) distinct non-sender nodes apart from \\(j\\). Definition 1.8 (Dolev-Strong protocol) At \\(t=0\\), the sender sends \\(v^*\\) to all nodes and outputs \\(v^*\\). Next repeat for \\(t=1, \\dots, f+1\\): If a non-sender \\(j\\) is newly convinced of \\(v\\) at time \\(t\\) by message \\(m\\), the node adds its own signature to \\(m\\) and sends \\((m, s)\\) to all other non-senders. For each nonsender, if outputs \\(v\\) it’s convinced by exactly one \\(v\\), else outputs \\(\\perp\\). Theorem 1.1 (Dolev-Strong) Byzantine Broadcast 1.6 is solvable under: Permissioned setting with \\(n\\) nodes 1.3 under PKI assumptions 1.4. Synchronous communication 1.5. Arbitrary bound on Byzantine nodes. Note that the \\(f=n, n-1\\) case satisfies validity and agreement trivially. Proof idea: honest nodes broadcast what they’re convinced by, and protocol runs for long enough so that there’re not enough Byzantine nodes to collude Let’s first prove validity; considering an honest sender (validity only has bite for honest senders), an honest node can only ever be convinced of \\(v^*\\) since convincing messages has to be signed by the sender, and Byzantine nodes can’t forge the sender’s signature. Honest non-senders are also convinced by the honest sender at \\(t=0\\). Proceeding to agreement: validity implies agreement if the sender is honest. Assuming Byzantine sender, we prove that when protocol terminates, all honest non-senders are convinced of the same set of values. Assuming that an honest non-sender \\(j\\) is newly convinced at: \\(t\\leq f\\): this implies that the sender and \\(t-1\\) non-senders signed the message. Then \\(j\\) proceeds to sign the message and broadcast; this message convinces all non-senders at \\(t+1\\). \\(t=f+1\\): this implies that the Byzantine sender and \\(t-1=f\\) non-senders signed the message. Since there’re at most \\(f\\) Byzantine nodes, at least one honest non-sender has signed the message, so all other nodes are convinced. Note that the \\(t=f+1\\) round of checks is paramount; suppose we terminate at time \\(t\\), then the Byzantine nodes can collude to produce a convincing message to one of the honest nodes, which does not have time to broadcast this to other honest nodes. Definition 1.9 (Byzantine Agreement) Similar to Byzantine broadcast 1.6, but each node has private bit \\(b_j\\in \\{0, 1\\}\\) with at most \\(f\\) Byzantine nodes. Solution must satisfy termination and: Agreement: all honest nodes output the same bit. Validity: when all honest nodes have the same private input, they all terminate with \\(b\\). Theorem 1.2 (deterministic BA-BB reduction) Given \\(f&lt;n/2\\), there exists a deterministic BA solution iff there exists a deterministic BB solution. Proof Given \\(\\pi\\) solving the BB problem, construct a BA protocol as follows: Nodes take turn to Byzantine-broadcast their private input \\(b_j\\). Output majority value. Validity: when all nodes have the same private input \\(b\\), their private inputs are consistently broadcasted to all other honest nodes since \\(\\pi\\) is valid. Since \\(f&lt;n/2\\), honest nodes have consistent output by majority vote. Agreement: all honest nodes have the same “perception” of other nodes, so majority votes are consistent. Given a BA protocol \\(\\pi\\), construct a BB protocol as follows: \\(T=0\\): sender sends \\(v^*\\) to all non-senders. Everyone runs \\(\\pi\\) on their received bits. Agreement follows from \\(\\pi\\) satisfying agreement. Validity: when sender is honest, all honest nodes receive \\(v^*\\). Validity follows from BA validity of \\(\\pi\\). Illustrative questions Assume \\(n\\geq 3\\) and consider the following protocol: \\(t=0\\): sender sends private bit with signature to all other nodes. The sender terminates with its own private bit. \\(t=1\\): every non-sender node \\(j\\) echoes what it heard from the sender to all non-sender nodes. \\(t=2\\): every non-sender node collects all the votes it has received and outputs majority vote. Several questions: For \\(f=1\\) does this protocol satisfy agreement? Yes. Suppose sender Byzantine, the honest non-sender nodes will agree on their votes (i.e. what they heard from the sender). Suppose a non-sender Byzantine, they’re unable to overturn \\(n-1&gt;1\\) consistent votes. For \\(f=1\\), does this protocol satisfy validity? Yes. Honest sender broadcasts \\(v^*\\) to \\(n-2\\) other honest nodes, so there are \\(n-1&gt;1\\) honest votes contributing to the correct value. For \\(f=2\\), does this protocol satisfy agreement? No. Consider \\(n=4\\) with 1 Byzantine sender and non-sender. Sender sends \\(0, 1\\) to honest nodes \\(a, b\\), respectively, and Byzantine non-sender echoes message \\(0, 1\\) to \\(a, b\\) respectively. Then \\(a, b\\) outputs \\(0, 1\\). For \\(f=2\\), does protocol satisfy validity? Yes. Byzantine nodes cannot forge alternative vote. Recall Dolev-Strong protocol. Suppose we stop it one step earlier with nodes committing to output at time \\(f\\) rather than \\(f+1\\). Does it continue to satisfy agreement? No. Consider Byzantine sender with \\(f-1\\) Byzantine non-senders. At time \\(f\\), they can collude to produce a convincing message to send to a select subset of honest non-senders, while appearing honest to everyone else. Does the protocol in (5) satisfy validity? Yes. Non-senders cannot forge signatures. State-machine replication Byzantine broadcast is also known as a one-shot consensus problem. We proceed to multi-shot consensus and demonstrate reduction to Byzantine Broadcast. Definition 1.10 (state-machine replication) We’re working in a permissioned setting. Each honest node receives an incoming stream of requests and attempts to make this common knowledge; it also maintains an append-only log. A solution should satisfy Liveliness: every request to an honest node is eventually included in the log of honest nodes. Consistency: at any time, the log of each honest replica are pairwise prefixes (i.e. order cannot be messed up). Theorem 1.3 (SMR reduces to BB) In a synchronous and permissioned setting with PKI, given a BB protocol \\(\\pi\\) which terminates in time \\(T\\), there exists a solution to SMR. At each step \\(0, T, 2T, 3T, \\dots\\) Define the leader node by round-robin ordering. The leader collects its own not-yet-included requests and appends them to its local log. The leader broadcasts the updated local log via \\(\\pi\\). When \\(\\pi\\) terminates, every node \\(j\\) appends its not-yet-included requests to the received log. BB (validity, agreement)\\(\\implies\\) SMR (liveliness, consistency) Liveliness: request submitted to \\(j\\) will be included in the log of all honest nodes when it’s \\(j\\)’s term to be the leader, by \\(\\pi\\)’s validity property. Consistency: \\(\\pi\\)’s consistency implies that nodes execute the appending operation consistently. FLM impossibility result Theorem 1.4 (FLM impossibility result) In a synchronous model with \\(f\\geq n/3\\), there is no Byzantine broadcast protocol satisfying termination, agreement, and validity. Proof: hexagon argument for \\(n=3, f=1\\) plus reductions For simplicity, consider \\(n=3\\) with nodes \\(a, b, c\\). Consider the hexagon connection below with \\(\\pi\\) running on each node; note that the hexagon type-checks since each triple of contiguous nodes only involve one sender and two non-senders: Crucially, the hexagon setup with 6 honest nodes is equivalent to three Byzantine setups, with the Byzantine node simulating the encircled honest nodes. Scenario \\(1\\) forces \\(a=b=0\\), scenario \\(2\\) \\(b=c=0\\), and scenario \\(c\\) \\(c=a&#39;=0\\) but \\(a&#39;=-1\\), so either agreement or validity has to be violated. Proceeding to the general case, we provide a reduction that BB protocol for \\((n&#39;=3k, f&#39;=k)\\) provides a BB protocol for \\((3, 1)\\): given a \\((3k, k)\\) BB protocol, let node \\(j\\in [3]\\) simulate nodes \\([(j-1)k, jk]\\) in \\(\\pi\\). Since each node simulates \\(k\\) nodes, there are at most \\(k\\) Byzantine nodes in the simulated protocol, so validity and consistency follows. A \\((3k+1, k+1)\\) protocol provides similar reduction: even if single node simulating \\(k+1\\) nodes is Byzantine, there are at most \\(k+1\\) Byzantine nodes in the simulated protocol. Finally, a \\((3k+2, k+1)\\) protocol reduces for each of the physical three nodes simulating \\((k, k+1, k+1)\\) virtual nodes. Even if the only physical Byzantine node simulates \\(k+1\\) virtual nodes, there’re only \\(k+1\\) Byzantine nodes in the extended setup. Remarks are in order: The pivotal theorem below does not contradict Dolev-Strong 1.1. The hexagon simulation relies on lack of PKI. The crux of the proof is that: Byzantine node can perfectly simulate hexagon cuts. Since honest nodes cannot distinguish between all-honest hexagon and Byzantine-cut scenarios, it must make the same decision in both runs. In the presence of PKI, starting with scenario (1), the Byzantine non-sender instantiates honest nodes \\(c, c&#39;, a&#39;, b\\) and knows their secret keys; this makes \\(a, b\\) unable to tell the hexagon apart from scenario (1). However, we cannot force \\(b=c\\) by scenario \\(2\\) since the Byzantine simulator cannot forget the honest \\(a\\)’s signature.
